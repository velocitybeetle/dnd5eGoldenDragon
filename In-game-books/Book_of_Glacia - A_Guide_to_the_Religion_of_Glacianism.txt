The Book of Glacia: A Guide to the Religion of Glacianism

Introduction:
Greetings, fellow adventurers. I am Father Malachi, a priest of the Glacianism religion. 
In this book, I will provide a comprehensive guide to the beliefs and practices of our faith. 
Glacianism is centered around the worship of the goddess Glacia, whose holy site is the 
magnificent mountain that bears her name. The tenets of our religion are based on the 
principles of goodness, kindness, and compassion, and we believe that by living according 
to these values, we can honor the goddess and improve our own lives.

Chapter 1: History
The history of Glacianism is intertwined with that of the metallic dragons. 
In ancient times, a great war erupted between the dragons and their evil counterparts, 
the chromatic dragons. Glacia, who had always had a special connection to the metallic 
dragons, joined the fight on their side. With her help, the metallic dragons were 
able to emerge victorious, and Glacia became revered as their patron goddess. 
Since then, Glacia has been worshiped by people all over the world who seek her 
protection and guidance.

Chapter 2: The Mountain
The mountain of Glacia is a sacred site for all Glacianists. It is said that the 
goddess herself resides on the mountain's peak, and that her presence can be felt 
by those who are pure of heart. The mountain is also home to many metallic dragons, 
who have pledged their loyalty to the goddess. Glacianists make pilgrimages to the 
mountain to pay homage to the goddess and seek her blessings.

Chapter 3: The Tenets
The tenets of Glacianism are based on the principles of goodness, kindness, and compassion. 
They are as follows:

3.Show kindness and compassion to all living beings.
4.Do not take more than what you need.

Chapter 4: Living by the Tenets
Living by the tenets of Glacianism can be challenging, but it is also incredibly rewarding. 
As a priest of the faith, I strive to embody these principles in my daily life. 
I try to help those in need whenever I can, whether it's by offering a listening ear or providing 
material aid. I also make an effort to be kind and compassionate to all living beings, from 
the smallest insects to the largest dragons. By living in accordance with these values, 
I feel a sense of connection to the goddess and to the world around me.

and offerings to the goddess. Many Glacianists also participate in volunteer work and other forms 
of charitable giving. Additionally, some followers of the faith undertake pilgrimages to the mountain

connection to the natural world and the creatures that inhabit it. As a priest of Glacia,
